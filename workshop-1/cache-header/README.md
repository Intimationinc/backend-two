# Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement cache control headers in a Spring Boot application using industry-standard best practices. The goal is to efficiently manage caching strategies like public and private caching for different API endpoints. The cache control logic is implemented using a combination of custom annotations, Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), and Spring MVC interceptors to provide a clean and scalable solution.
## Key Concepts Used

**1. Custom Annotations (`@CacheControl`):**

A custom annotation `@CacheControl` is used to mark controller methods with specific cache control directives. This approach provides declarative and reusable cache configurations for different endpoints. You can easily define public or private cache policies for routes.

**2.    Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):**

The project leverages Spring AOP to apply cache control headers at runtime based on the `@CacheControl` annotation. Using an aspect (CacheControlAspect), we intercept the controller methods annotated with `@CacheControl` and dynamically set the required cache control headers.

**3. Global Cache Control Fallback Using Interceptors:**

For routes that are not explicitly annotated with the` @CacheControl`, a global cache control fallback is provided using a Spring MVC interceptor (CacheControlInterceptor). This ensures that every route gets a cache-control header, even if one is not manually specified.

**4. Separation of Concerns:**

The use of AOP and interceptors separates the cache logic from the core business logic of the application. This makes the code more maintainable, easier to test, and scalable for future extensions or changes in caching policy.


**5. Extensibility:**

The approach used allows for easy future extensions. For example, additional cache directives can be introduced without modifying the core application logic. Moreover, caching configurations can be externalized into properties files for environment-based configurations.
## What This Project Does
This Spring Boot project provides an example of how to implement cache control at the HTTP response level by:

* Defining and applying cache control headers for specific API endpoints.
* Supporting both public and private caching strategies.
* Applying default cache headers (e.g., no-cache) for routes without specified cache control policies.

Endpoints can be annotated with the custom `@CacheControl` annotation to specify caching behavior directly in the code, making it more readable and easy to configure.

# React Cache Control & WebSocket Chat

## Project Setup Instructions

### 1. Start the Frontend

To start the frontend project, follow these steps:

#### Navigate to the frontend directory:

Cache-control-react/react-cache-control
Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at:
http://localhost:5173/

#### Start the WebSocket Server

To start the WebSocket server for private and public chat channels:
Navigate to the server directory:
WebSocket-python-express-js-private-public-channel/server-js
Install dependencies and run the server:

```bash
npm install
node server.js
```

The WebSocket server will be running at:
http://localhost:5000/

#### Simulate Users

Now you can simulate multiple users by opening multiple tabs in your browser, each acting as a separate user. Use the following link to access the frontend:

http://localhost:5173/
You can now chat in both public and private channels using different tabs as different users, as demonstrated in the video.

## Video Demonstration

Refer to the video for a demonstration of how the chat application works, including both public and private channels.
